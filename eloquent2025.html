<p>
	  The ELOQUENT evaluation lab experiments with new evaluation methods for generative language models to meet some of the challenges in the path from laboratory to application. The intention of the lab is to explore the following important characteristics of generative language model quality:
	  <ol>
<li><b>Trustworthiness</b>: a many-faceted notion which involves topical relevance and truthfulness, discourse competence, reasoning in language, controllability, and robustness across varied input.
<li><b>Multi-linguality and cultural fit</b>: the suitability of a language model for some cultural and linguistic area.
<li><b>Self-assessment</b>: the reliability of a language model to assess the quality of itself or some other language model, using as little human effort as possible.     
<li><b>Limits of language models</b>: the delimitation of world knowledge and generative capacity.
</ol>

	<!-- ***  TASK LIST  ***  -->
	
	<div class="column">
	  <div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">Planned tasks:</span></div>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Dictionary Definition Task</li>, testing the capability of a generative language model to select the correct terminological definition from a list of sham and correct choices. 
	    <li>Voight-Kampff Task</li>, a continuation from the 2024 task on generating text that appears to be authored by humans.
	    <li>Robustness task</li>, as an evolved version of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a0-nkkNiaD8FfetsCoBkL_WwxsZVGZfrvxKIk280w2I">2024 task</a>, on the capability of a generative languag emodel to handle linguistic and cultural input variation consistently.
	    <li> For 2025, we introduce two new more demanding tasks: Preference Score Prediction and Reasoning. These tasks will involve more complex interaction with the system than the previous three tasks and the organisers will proceed by early involvement of teams that develop language models to ensure takeup. </li>

%\textbf{Silo AI}, established in 2017, is one of Europe’s largest private AI labs with customers in several commericial and public sectors. Silo AI is currently working on making generative AI an industrially reliable and verifiably practical solution for its customers and views this initiative as a path to ensure the quality of its offerings. 
%\textbf{RISE Research Institutes of Sweden}  is a national research institute, whose department of computer science (and its predecessor, the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, SICS) has a long tradition of research in natural language processing and information retrieval, including groundbreaking work in distributional semantics. The NLP group at RISE has recently been involved in efforts to train large generative language models for Scandinavian languages, in collaboration with AI Sweden. Other prominent research themes are multilingual language models and resource-efficient NLP. Several researchers at RISE have extensive experience of organising shared tasks in NLP.
%\textbf{AI Sweden}  is the national centre for applied AI in Sweden, which brings together more than 100 partners across the public and private sectors as well as academia. AI Sweden is funded by the Swedish government through the Swedish innovation agency (Vinnova), and by partners, both public and private. Together, we invest in generating tools and resources to accelerate the use of AI for the benefit of our society, our competitiveness, and everyone living in Sweden. AI Sweden has three main focus areas: AI transformation and adoption, ecosystem and relations, and AI labs in three different areas: NLU, data factory, and edge learning. The NLU research group focuses specifically on large language models, and has developed the first large language model for the Nordic languages, GPT-SW3.
