	    <span class="headline hl1">Dictionary Definition</span>
	  </div>
	  <p>
The Dictionary Definition Task is new for the second edition, and involves having participating systems play a variant of the popular Dictionary parlour game, implemented and marketed as a popular 1980's board game under various names such as Balderdash, Rappakalja, or Kokkelimonke. The idea is for each player to formulate plausible and convincing definitions to uncommmon and unknown words. These definitions are shared to the other players, with a correct definition mixed in with the player-authored ones, and points are awarded to a player's definition if other players are fooled into believing it to be the true one.

This task will be implemented as a system-submission task, where participants are expected to provide a runnable script to be executed by the organisers. The participants are restricted to a shared set of pre-trained models, which will be fine-tuned over the course of the experiment by the organisers, with both helpful and confounding data, and the scoring will be influenced by the robustness of the script, its prompting, and its continued adaptation to incoming data.

	  <p>
	    The Preference Prediction Task is a new task for the second edition and will explore the capabality of systems to predict human preferences for different outputs from generative language models. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We will provide the participants with a novel dataset of human-based preferences and explanations, which will be collected from scratch. This task offers two sub-tasks with participation open to anyone:
<ol><li><b>Preference prediction.</b> Predict human preferences between given LLM responses; performance metric is the accuracy score.</li>
  <li><b>Preference prediction and explanation generation</b> Generate judgements explaining the choices made in sub-task 1; performance metrics include standard natural language generation evaluation metrics.
  </li>
  </ol>

In an evolved verion of the first year's Topical Quiz Task, the Sensemaking task will require participating systems to produce a quiz, not for a topic, but for a given syllabus set of texts, potentially noisy or erroneous and to answer to quiz questions posed by other participating systems. A correct answer is one that is aligned with the syllabus without relying on other knowledge.

<p>
	  The ELOQUENT evaluation lab experiments with new evaluation methods for generative language models in order to meet some of the challenges in the path from laboratory to application. The intention of the lab is to explore the following important characteristics of generative language model quality:
	  <ol>
<li><b>Trustworthiness</b>: a many-faceted notion which involves topical relevance and truthfulness, discourse competence, reasoning in language, controllability, and robustness across varied input.
<li><b>Multi-linguality and cultural fit</b>: the suitability of a language model for some cultural and linguistic area.
<li><b>Self-assessment</b>: the reliability of a language model to assess the quality of itself or some other language model, using as little human effort as possible.     
<li><b>Limits of language models</b>: the delimitation of world knowledge and generative capacity.
</ol>

	<!-- ***  HOW TO PARTICIPATE  ***  -->


	<div class="column">
          <div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Sign up for the tasks!</span></div>
	  <p>
	    Participating in a task can be done as a simple one-off experiment.
	  </p><p>
	    We welcome experimental reports, which will be published in the working notes of the workshop, but there is no requirement to submit anything. If experiments involve hypothesis testing and exploration of more lasting value, they can be revised and published elsewhere in more archival channels. Typically, this is done after the workshops where ideas and learnings have been exchanged between participants. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Sign up to join in the discussion! We will announce a conversation channel here during the fall of 2024.
	  </p>
	    
	    Here is how to participate in the discussion about task details:

<p>
Mu-SHROOM is a non-English-centric SemEval-2025 shared task to advance the SOTA in hallucination detection for content generated with LLMs. Mu-SHROOM has annotated hallucinated content in 10 different languages from top -tier LLMs: Arabic (Modern standard), Chinese (Mandarin), English, Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish. You can participate in as many languages as youâ€™d like by accurately identifying spans of hallucinated content.
</p>
<p>
<b>Key Dates:</b> Dev set already available; test set released by Jan 10, 2025; evaluation phase ends Jan 31 2025. SemEval workshop in Summer 2025 (co-located with an upcoming *ACL conference).
