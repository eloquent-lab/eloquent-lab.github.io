<p>
	  The ELOQUENT evaluation lab experiments with new evaluation methods for generative language models in order to meet some of the challenges in the path from laboratory to application. The intention of the lab is to explore the following important characteristics of generative language model quality:
	  <ol>
<li><b>Trustworthiness</b>: a many-faceted notion which involves topical relevance and truthfulness, discourse competence, reasoning in language, controllability, and robustness across varied input.
<li><b>Multi-linguality and cultural fit</b>: the suitability of a language model for some cultural and linguistic area.
<li><b>Self-assessment</b>: the reliability of a language model to assess the quality of itself or some other language model, using as little human effort as possible.     
<li><b>Limits of language models</b>: the delimitation of world knowledge and generative capacity.
</ol>

	<!-- ***  TASK LIST  ***  -->
	
	<div class="column">
	  <div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">Dictionary Definition Task</span></div>
	  This task tests the capability of a generative language model to select the correct terminological definition from a list of sham and correct choices. It is inspired by the dictionary board game which is marketed in various languages under various names where a player picking a rare word from a dictionary and the other players write sham definitions for the word. Each player then needs to identify which definition is the actual one and players gain points from fooling other players into believing their suggested definitions are the actual real one. 
	    </p>
	  <p>
	  A variant of this game will be formulated as an ELOQUENT task. This is a new task in 2025. Details to come.

	  <p>
	    This task explores whether automatically-generated text can be distinguished from human-authored text, and is organised in collaboration with the PAN lab at CLEF.

	    This task ran in 2024 and tests the capability of a model to handle input variation -- e.g.  dialectal, sociolectal, and cross-cultural --  as represented by human-generated equivalent but non-identical varieties of input prompts.

	<div class="column">
          <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">2025 Workshop in Madrid</span></div>
	  <p>
	    The second ELOQUENT Workshop will be held at the <a href="http://clef2025.clef-initiative.eu/">CLEF conference in Madrid</a>, September 9-12 2024. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The workshop program will hold overview presentations, an invited keynote, and some selected participant presentations.

	<!-- ***  HOW TO PARTICIPATE  ***  -->


	<div class="column">
          <div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Sign up for the tasks!</span></div>
	  <p>
	    Participating in a task can be done as a simple one-off experiment.
	  </p><p>
	    We welcome experimental reports, which will be published in the working notes of the workshop, but there is no requirement to submit anything. If experiments involve hypothesis testing and exploration of more lasting value, they can be revised and published elsewhere in more archival channels. Typically, this is done after the workshops where ideas and learnings have been exchanged between participants. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Sign up to join in the discussion! We will announce a conversation channel here during the fall of 2024.
	  </p>
