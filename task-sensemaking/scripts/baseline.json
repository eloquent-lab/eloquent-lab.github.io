But an increasingly large group of people seem to believe that vaccinations put our health at risk. There are many reports on the internet of negative vaccination effects such as allergies, disabilities and even deaths. And it's true, vaccination can have side effects\n\n0.037941;10.0;1.0: Vaccinations are incredibly important for fighting disease. But an increasingly large group of people seem to believe that vaccinations put our health at risk. There are many reports on the internet of negative vaccination effects such as allergies, disabilities and even deaths\n\n0.032379;10.0;1.0:  They bring serious diseases back from the brink of extinction. The biggest side effect of vaccinations is a reduction in the number of dead children. Vaccinations are one of our most powerful weapons in the fight against monsters that many of us have already forgotten.

The biggest side effect of vaccinations is a reduction in the number of dead children. Vaccinations are one of our most powerful weapons in the fight against monsters that many of us have already forgotten\n\n0.025581;10.0;1.0:  And what about deaths? It is actually very difficult to say whether even a single one of our 10 million vaccinated children would die. We have done a lot of research on this and spoken to many experts. Excluding self-assessments, we could only find a small handful of documented deaths, out of hundreds of millions of children who have received the MMR vaccine since 1971. Measles is many, many thousands of times more dangerous to our children than the absolute worst case of vaccine side effects\n\n0.025056;10.0;1.0:  This is why young children, for example, are constantly ill. They have not yet formed enough memory cells. And we rely on this great, natural mechanism when we vaccinate. As great as memory cells are, getting them through an infection is unpleasant and potentially dangerous\n\n0.02458;10.0;1.0:  But do you think that makes it safer not to buckle children in? But wait, what if your child is actually allergic? What if our facts don't apply to your specific situation? That's when you would have to become the biggest vaccination advocate of all. Because if you can't get your child vaccinated, only the community can protect them. This is called herd immunity and it's the only protection your unvaccinated child has. Herd immunity means that so many people are immune to a disease that the pathogen cannot spread, but dies before it can reach its victims\n\n0.02449;10.0;1.0:  But do you think that makes it safer not to buckle children in?

It's difficult to directly compare the side effects of vaccinations with the effects of diseases. For example, hundreds of millions of people in the West have been vaccinated against measles. But there were only 83,000 cases of measles in Europe in 2018. With such disparate numbers, even minor side effects seem frightening when compared to the consequences of a disease we no longer even know about\n\n0.020889;10.0;1.0:  Approximately 20,000 children will die from measles. But that's not all. The children who survive will have a severely damaged immune system that takes a long time to recover. They are therefore more susceptible to further illnesses\n\n0.020462;10.0;1.0:  What are they and what happens if your child is affected?

It is actually very difficult to say whether even a single one of our 10 million vaccinated children would die. We have done a lot of research on this and spoken to many experts. Excluding self-assessments, we could only find a small handful of documented deaths, out of hundreds of millions of children who have received the MMR vaccine since 1971.

But wait, what if your child is actually allergic? What if our facts don't apply to your specific situation? That's when you would have to become the biggest vaccination advocate of all. Because if you can't get your child vaccinated, only the community can protect them. This is called herd immunity and it's the only protection your unvaccinated child has.
