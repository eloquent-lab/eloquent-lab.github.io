Takže, tady jsou ty skvělé technice, co jste řekl. A to je vlastně vlastně vlastně technice, kde jste jenom vysvětši úplně úplně úplně, takže to je metod základních základních základních, nevímáš, kdo je kříli představit a jak. Takže nějaká základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základních základ
what error types are there, which may be important for some particle applications. So some applications may be sensitive to grammar errors, some may be sensitive to negation drop and other things. So that's a gray box. And then if you are an author of the system, you are most interested in knowing which component fails, doesn't do its job properly, and that would be kind of glass box evaluation. So you're checking how far this information from the source got actually in the system
where it was lost in the processing. As you see, most of effort is being devoted to the black box methods and that's because you can apply these methods to all the systems. So there is regular competitions in machine translation, the WMT task, and that has, aside from competing in machine translation, also had a track on competing in or internally, like, competes, like how do
lot of insight comes from. So the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are somewhat correlated. You cannot speak about the adequacy of the output if the fluency is so bad that you don't understand it at all. These two scales also correlated in human judgments. So today they are kind of revisited in
will see on a slide in a second. And this direct assessment uses just one scale normally. Then there is relative ranking and that could be the relative ranking could be applied to either the whole sentences or some smaller chunks of of those. That's the ranking of constituents. Then you can do another thing. Well I'll discuss them in a second. So some comprehension
preserves the meaning in some way and then you can check whether the translated text serves the purpose. So that's the task-based evaluation which is very costly but this is actually what you are after. So the question here could be do I dress appropriately if I read the Chinese weather forecast translated into English or was there some information lost and I didn't
