Topic 3: Animal Behavior We will explore fascinating material related specifically to the characteristics of animals, as certain behaviors are unique to them. We are aware of examples of unique and often puzzling animal behavior. Sometimes it appears intelligent, while at other times, it seems irrational. So in this section we will try to answer the question “why?”. What is the biological meaning of this or that behavior? What elements does it consist of? These questions are answered by the science of ethology, which you will also learn about. After studying this unit, the animal world will become more understandable and interesting to you. Animal Behavior and How to Study It 43 One of the characteristics of animals is their behavior. We know that hares, foxes, wolves, herons, flies, beetles, and crayfish behave differently. Knowing the patterns of animal behavior makes it much easier for people to coexist with them on the same planet. Ethology The science of animal behavior in their natural habitat is called ethology (from the Greek “ethos” - custom, character and “logos” - word, science). Ethology studies the nature of instincts, acquired behavioral reactions, how animals communicate with each other (communication), how their behavior changes under the influence of various factors, etc. The development of modern ethology is associated with the name of the prominent Austrian scientist K. Lorenz, who, together with N. Tinbergen and M. Fischer, received the Nobel Prize in 1973 for outstanding discoveries in the field of ethology. general biological methods of studying ethology The following biological methods are used in ethology: observation, comparative and descriptive method, experiment, monitoring, and modeling. Observation is the purposeful perception and recording of the behavior of the object under study. The researcher does not interfere with biological processes. Observation is conducted for a specific purpose and according to a specific plan. The results of the observation are recorded, and may be filmed or photographed, or audio recorded. An experiment is a research method in which the researcher actively intervenes. Experiments can be conducted both in nature and in the laboratory. Laboratories are equipped with the necessary devices, and the experiment itself requires the use of experimental animals. Not all ethologists consider this method acceptable for ethology. Modeling is a research method based on the simulation of complex processes. It is especially interesting to use this method to study group relationships. Animal behavior and methods of its study Specific ethological methods There are research methods that are used only in ethology. For example, K. Lorenz developed an ethological method for studying animal behavior in semi-captivity. On the basis of observation, description, and comparison, scientists formulate scientific hypotheses - assumptions that explain the facts. A specific method is the compilation of species-specific ethograms - “behavioral catalogs” of different species. By comparing ethograms, scientists draw conclusions about the evolution of different forms of behavior. Observations of large ungulates are carried out using the cartographic method - the paths along which animals migrate are mapped. To do this, the researcher follows the tracks and records all animal movements. This gives an idea of individual animal areas, their borders, and relationships with “neighbors”. Ethological research is conducted by zoologists in nature reserves, sanctuaries, and scientific expeditions. Interesting data were obtained when the researcher settled near the objects of study to make observations. Observations can be made of tamed animals that have been returned to their natural environment, animals kept in enclosures, etc. Remember the most important things Ethology is the science of animal behavior. Ethology uses general biological methods, such as observation, experimentation, and modeling. In addition, specific ethological methods and techniques are used: observations in semi-captivity, drawing up ethograms, mapping methods.... The more complex the structure of the organism, the more difficult it is to manifest irritability. The nervous system is the basis for the irritability of multicellular organisms. Sensitivity and behavior Hundreds of times we have observed - directly or by watching videos - the behavior of animals at home, in nature, in a zoo or circus. You can think of many examples of amazing animal behaviors that are even difficult to explain. People have been observing animal behavior for a long time. Knowledge of its peculiarities helped ancient people hunt, avoid predators and poisonous animals, and tame wild animals. What is behavior? It is an adaptive action or a system of actions of an organism in response to the external or internal environment. Any behavior is a complex combination of instinctive and acquired elements. The basis for the formation of animal behavior in the environment is irritability - one of the basic properties of the living, the ability of a living organism to perceive changes in the external and internal environment and respond to them. The more complex an organism is, the more complex its behavior is. Unicellular animals are characterized by simple behavioral reactions - taxa. Taxis are oriented movements caused by certain stimuli. For example, euglena green will move to more lighted areas of water. Reflexes Behavior is based on reflexes - the body's response to the environment with the participation of the central nervous system. They can be unconditioned (innate) and conditioned Congenital and acquired behavior Fig. 44.1 Learning and training are based on conditioned (acquired) reflexes. Examples of unconditioned reflexes are breathing, coughing, sneezing, pulling your hand away from a hot object, etc. These reflexes are inherent in all members of a species, regardless of whether they have seen their relatives display such reflexes or not. Natural behavior can be very complex. For example, mating behavior of animals, nest building, offspring care, etc. Conditioned reflexes are developed as a result of life experience and are inherent in organisms with a developed nervous system. For example, a dog performing certain actions in response to the owner's signals, rats avoiding traps and certain poisons, etc. Conditioned reflexes are the basis of learning (Figure 44.1). To develop a conditioned reflex, a conditioned stimulus must be combined with an unconditioned stimulus, such as feeding. This is used in animal training. If the conditioned stimulus is not reinforced by an unconditioned stimulus, the conditioned reflex will eventually fade and disappear. For example, you have trained chickens to come to you at a conditioned sound stimulus - “cluck” - after which they received an unconditioned stimulus - food. Then, for the purpose of the experiment, you combine feeding with the sound of “pussies”. And after a while, the chickens will not react to the “chick-chick” but will rush to the “kitty-kitty” sound. Conditioned reflexes are important for adaptation and allow animals to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The better developed the nervous system and brain, the faster and more conditioned reflexes are developed. Instinct An instinct (from the Latin instinctus - impulse) is a set of innate stereotypical forms of animal behavior that arise in response to external or internal stimuli. The biological significance of instincts is to ensure the survival of the species. There are different types of instincts. Animal behaviour Instincts Directed to the survival of the individual Directed to the survival of the species - food - sexual - protective - parental - bonding Instincts are relative in nature, because they are effective only under certain conditions. If conditions change, instincts can even be harmful. For example, birds incubate their eggs, which is a very strong parental instinct. But if you remove the egg at a late stage of incubation and place a stone instead, for example, the birds will not stop incubating, even though this action is meaningless. Instinct cannot provide a response to changed conditions. Therefore, learning plays an important role in the process of evolution. Learning Learning is based on conditioned reflexes. Conditioned reflexes, by associating unconditional neutral stimuli with conditional ones, allow an animal to adapt to changes in the environment. A form of learning is imprinting (Figure 44.2), which is based on an innate response that is supplemented by individual experience. For example, duck chicks have an innate response to follow the first person they see after hatching. Usually it is their mother, but in the experiment, when they were shown a ball, they followed the ball, when they first saw a person, they followed the person. Fig. 44.2. An example of imprinting is when chicks follow a duck Congenital and learned behavior Another way of learning is when an animal learns by trial and error. When an animal gets a positive result, it memorizes it. A more advanced way is imitation, when an animal repeats certain actions after an older or more experienced individual. This is how predators teach their cubs to hunt, birds to sing, etc. Learning is based on unconditional reflexes and instincts. For example, it is known that penguins are not afraid of people. They have no enemies on land, and their genetic apparatus has no innate trigger for a “ground enemy”. Chimpanzees are able to perform a learning task almost instantly, to change behavior by establishing connections and patterns between objects and phenomena. But not in the abstract, but only with what he sees or touches. Remember the most important thing Behavior is an adaptive action or system of actions of the organism in response to the external or internal environment. Reflexes are the body's responses to the external environment with the participation of the central nervous system. They can be unconditional (innate) and conditional (acquired). Instinct is a set of innate stereotypical forms of animal behavior that arise in response to external or internal stimuli. Learning is based on conditioned reflexes, unconditioned reflexes, and instincts.... What senses will help it? Does it even need to migrate that far? Interesting questions lead to equally interesting answers. animal migration Migration is the regular movement of animals of the same species from one habitat to another. Most often, migrations are connected with the processes of feeding and reproduction. For example, swallows and storks breed in Ukraine. This is convenient for them because we have a lot of food (insects for swallows and water animals for storks) in summer. However, with the onset of the cold season, food becomes less and less, and then it disappears altogether. Therefore, these birds have to migrate to wait out the hard times in warmer regions. A logical question arises: why don't they stay in warm countries for good? It's very simple: competition. There are plenty of competitors for food in warm countries. Homing The word “homing” comes from the English word home, which means to return home. This is the name of the home instinct that we can observe in many animals. It is best seen in animals that make long-distance migrations. These are eels, sea turtles, salmon and other animals. They can travel thousands of kilometers, but they still return to the place where they were born to reproduce. For example, one species of sea turtle breeds only on a certain beach in Mexico, and nowhere else in the world! The turtles gather there, simultaneously arriving from the shores of Canada, the Mediterranean, and the Azores. The good memory of these turtles is also evidenced by the fact that for the first time after birth they return to their native beach only at the age of 30, after the completion of sexual maturation. Orientation and animal migration Examples of homing can also be found in domestic animals. Both dogs and cats can travel quite long distances to return to the place they consider home. But homing is much better developed in carrier pigeons. Centuries of selection have resulted in these birds becoming excellent at finding their way home. ways animals navigate animals use all of their senses to navigate in space. Visual memory allows them to memorize the place they consider their home. Many animals can navigate by memorizing what the area looks like. Surprisingly, hearing can play an important role in orientation. For example, pigeons can hear infrasounds that spread over tens of kilometers. What can we say about whales, which navigate the ocean space relying more on hearing than on sight! Both terrestrial and aquatic animals use their sense of smell for orientation. For many fish, it becomes the most important means of orientation. Experiments have shown that salmon with a damaged sense of smell lose the ability to find their spawning grounds. Migratory birds mainly use solar, star and magnetic “compasses”. Knowing the position of the Sun relative to the horizon provides many opportunities for orientation. Remember the most important things Migration is the regular movement of animals of the same species from one habitat to another. The name “homing” refers to the instinct of home that we can observe in many animals. Animals use all of their senses to orient themselves in space...Animal Behavior 46 Animal Behavior The main forms of behavior are territorial, mating, feeding, defensive, and other behaviors. All of them include many additional factors, such as hierarchical relationships, ritual behavior, and communication. This gives rise to a considerable variety of animal behavior. Territorial behavior Fig. 46.1. Howler monkeys marking the boundaries of their territory Territorial behavior is the division of the territory occupied by a particular group into separate areas. Animals defend their territory because it affects their safety, food supply, ability to choose the best mate, etc. Animals mark their territory, defend it, and take it from each other. For example, dogs mark their territory with urine, bears with urine, scratching and gnawing on tree bark, birds with singing, etc. The territorial behavior of monkeys living in the rainforest is interesting. This can be seen very well on the example of monkeys in South America. A flock of monkeys marks its territory by calling out (Figure 46.1). If there is a conflict, two groups of monkeys try to shout each other down. The one who shouts louder and more rhythmically wins. By the way, winning such a competition results in the release of hormones into the bloodstream of the winning monkeys. These hormones cause them to feel a sense of satisfaction and euphoria. In case of defeat, the monkeys get upset and feel physically tired. Now think about how fans behave at sporting events. Doesn't it look like monkey behavior? And the result is the same. If you win - euphoria, satisfaction, joy! In case of defeat, it's sadness and grief. The same hormones that are secreted in the blood of monkeys are present in us. We inherited these behavioral programs from our distant ancestors who lived in the rainforest. Although we use them now for completely different purposes. Forms of animal behavior Fig. 46.2. Ritual behavior in cats Many animals engage in ritual behavior (Fig. 46.2), which can reduce the number of actual fights and injuries. These include threatening behaviors such as head tilting, fangs showing, fur or feathers standing up, growling, threatening cries, raising fins, and so on. Antagonistic behavior is the calming behavior of animals that occupy a lower position in the hierarchy. It keeps dominant individuals from attacking. In humans, such calming behaviors are smiling, shaking hands, etc. Fig. 46.3. Peacock mating and parenting behavior Mating behavior (Fig. 46.3) helps an animal find a mate. Observing animals during the mating season, we can see many interesting rituals. These include singing, special movements - “dancing”, nest building, “gifts”, etc. These rituals are called courtship. During courtship, an animal needs to overcome the boundaries of its individual space, which, of course, causes aggression. That's why during mating rituals, the male attempts to approach and retreat are observed. Mating behavior arose for a reason. In many animals, a female cannot feed her cubs on her own; she needs the help of a male. Therefore, during the mating ritual, males of many waterfowl offer females fish or bunches of algae. In this way, they demonstrate their ability to provide food for the female and chicks. Parental behavior (Fig. 46.4) is manifested in the care of offspring. It is especially developed in animals that have a small number of offspring. Birds build nests, warm and turn their eggs, feed their chicks, and teach them. Mammals also arrange a place for their cubs, feed them, protect them, and teach them. Even dinosaurs, which became extinct many millions of years ago, were characterized by this behavior. Most adult dinosaurs were too big to care for their young alone. 46.4. Parenting behavior: Hatching eggs The behaviour of young. But these animals built nests in which to lay their eggs and protected them. Feeding behavior Fig. 46.5. Cheetah feeding behavior Feeding behavior (Fig. 46.5) is characterized by great diversity in animals. It is associated with searching for, storing, and metabolizing food. All animals are highly sensitive to food substances. Predators get food by hunting, which involves different tactics. For example, felines wait for prey, while dogs and wolves chase it down. The giant blue whale is a filter animal. It takes water with small animals into its mouth and filters it through its whale whiskers. Large herbivores graze for food. Many animals have a hoarding behavior. For example, insects store food for their larvae (bees, horsemen, ants, etc.). Squirrels store nuts and mushrooms for the winter. The relatives of hares, pika hares, even make special stitches of grass, thus storing food for the winter. Hence the second name of these animals - haymakers. Aggressive and defensive behavior Defensive or protective behavior is aimed at avoiding danger. It is manifested in threatening postures, sounds, attacks, and injuries. Most animals use aggression during reproduction. In the absence of an aggressor, aggression can accumulate and be directed at any object. Aggressive behavior can also be provoked by an animal defending a territory that it considers its own. This type of aggressive behavior is most common in dogs. However, it can also be seen in other animals, such as cats, roosters, lions, etc. Exploratory behavior Exploratory behavior is an essential part of any animal's behavior. When an animal is looking for food, water, shelter, or a mate, it engages in exploratory behavior. Through this type of behavior, animals learn about the world around them and know where they can find food or other animals of their species. Forms of animal behavior Exploratory behavior is very important for an animal to detect danger. This is especially true for herbivores that are afraid of predators. Pay attention to the way a roe deer or horse approaches an unfamiliar place or watering hole (often shown in popular science films). The ears catch every sound, the eyes react to the slightest movement, the nose sniffs and picks up the faintest suspicious odors. It is very difficult for a predator to remain invisible to such a research animal. Hygienic behavior The hygienic behavior of animals is aimed at maintaining clean body integument and solving toilet issues. For nomadic animals that move a lot, there are no special problems with the toilet: where they stayed, there is a toilet. So they immediately move on. However, sedentary animals have to take this issue much more seriously, as it is not a good idea to litter their territory. Besides, it also increases the risk of getting sick. With this in mind, marmots, for example, make special holes in their burrows that serve as toilets. A great example of hygienic behavior is the search for insects in monkeys. In a monkey pack, all individuals take this very seriously. If monkeys don't examine each other, parasites can get into their fur. In addition, during such examinations, monkeys also remove dead skin scales and loose hairs. This process even has a special name - grooming. Remember the most important things Behavioral types are a conditional classification of numerous types of animal behavior. Behavior is formed under the influence of two main factors: hereditary information and environmental conditions. A particular type of behavior is the result of evolution and contributes to the survival and development of a biological species...Animal Behavior 47 Social Behavior Social behavior is a type of behavior. Animals form temporary or permanent groups that are associated with behavioral responses that help them survive. The set of these reactions is called social behavior. Communication Social behavior increases the chances of survival for the entire group and species. A system of communication is important for such groups because animals need to coordinate their actions. For example, humans communicate with sounds (speech, laughter, clapping hands), gestures, body postures, etc. Birds communicate through sounds, postures, and colors. The sounds of crickets, frogs, and mosquitoes perform an important function - they inform about the search for a mating partner. Smells also play an important role in communication. For example, many predators mark their territory with urine. Animals of many species use pheromones, special odorous substances, to communicate. They help male butterflies find their way to females several kilometers away. Hierarchy In addition, in such communities, each animal plays a specific role, i.e., the phenomenon of hierarchy occurs. The hierarchy establishes the distribution of functions between animals, the order of use of various “goods”, primarily food. For example, in a chicken coop, a linear hierarchy is established, according to which chicken A will peck at any chicken, chicken B will peck at all chickens except chicken A, chicken C will peck at all chickens except chicken A and chicken B, and so on. This type of hierarchy is typical of cows, mice, rats, peacocks, etc. The position of an animal in the hierarchy is usually determined by its size, strength, aggressiveness, and remains constant in a particular grouping in birds. Social animal behavior Hierarchy is of great positive importance in the life of a group. It reduces aggression related to food, the choice of a mating partner, etc. It reduces the number of fights and injuries, and resources are distributed in such a way that the most viable individuals are provided first. social organization The more stable groups of animals form, the higher the level of specialization, when each animal performs a specific role. Such functions can be food production, protection, care for offspring, etc. In primates, for example, such groups are quite flexible and dynamic, but in insects they are rigid. In insects such as termites, ants, and bees, roles are distributed among individuals according to their body structure and ability to reproduce. In a bee family, there is a queen female capable of reproduction, worker bees - underdeveloped females and male drones capable of reproduction. Each has its own functions. The queen and drones reproduce, while the worker bees take care of the offspring, build honeycombs, clean up the hive, protect it, and collect pollen and nectar. Information is transmitted through pheromones and special movements called dances. In this “dance”, the bee uses special movements to communicate the direction and distance to a food source. Remember the most important things Social, or community, behavior is one of the types of behavior that is important for animals that form groups. Communication, hierarchy, and social organization are important for this type of behavior...Animal Behavior 48 Types of Animal Groupings The famous ethologist and Nobel Prize winner K. Lorenz found that all animal groups can be divided into two broad groups. The first one is anonymous groups that do not have a specific structure. The second is individualized groups, which have a certain structure and in which each animal plays a role. Clusters and groups Animals can come together to form clusters and groups. A crowd is simply a collection of animals that have gathered in one place. For example, tadpoles may gather in one place in a pond because there is plenty of food. They do not form even a primitive community and do not distinguish between “friends” and “foes.” Communities differ from aggregations precisely because animals in them can distinguish between “friends” and “foes.” They recognize those who belong to their group and may have a negative attitude toward animals from other groups. anonymous groups Animals in anonymous groups distinguish members of their group from other animals of their species (Figure 48.1). But they do not distinguish between group members. Often, they use smell to recognize them: this individual smells like a member of our group, so it is “one of our own.” The arrival of a “stranger” in a group can cause different reactions in different animals. If a new individual joins a group of giraffes or kangaroos, the others will react quite calmly. After a while, they will get used to the newcomer, and he will become “one of their own.” Such anonymous groups are called open groups. Fig. 48.1. Anonymous group Types of animal groups But there are also closed anonymous groups. In them, group members meet “outsiders” very aggressively. For example, rats can simply kill an outsider. Anonymous groups greatly increase the chances of their members' survival. They have no leaders, and any animal can lead the group. Usually, an animal that notices danger gives a signal. It can be audible (such as a bird cry) or of a different nature. For example, fish that see danger emit special substances, and their neighbors react to the smell. individualized communities In these communities, animals know each other by sight. Individualized groups are based on personal contacts between animals. Each animal plays a certain role in them, so you can see leaders there. Leaders play the main role - they dominate other members of the group. But at the same time, such groups are characterized by family and friendly relations. There are many examples of such groups. These include a pack of wolves, a group of peacocks, a lion pride, and even chickens living in a chicken coop with one owner also form an individualized group. The ability to recognize members of their group allows animals to perform very complex actions. For example, wolves hunt for prey by organizing real raids. Remember the most important thing Anonymous groups consist of individuals who do not individually distinguish between members of their group. But they react to danger together, focusing on the signals they give each other. Individualized groups are made up of individuals who can individually distinguish between members of their group. This allows them to carry out very complex coordinated actions..Behavioral evolution Basic mental activity. The Evolution of Behavior 49 Any pet owner knows that their dog (cat, parrot, etc.) is very smart. What is the evidence of an animal's intelligence from the point of view of science? The ability to use tools? Or the ability to speak? Let's try to figure it out. The use of tools by animals In ancient times, it was believed that humans differed from animals in that they could use tools. But time passed, and it turned out that the use of tools is not an exclusive feature of humans. Quite a few animals also use them quite successfully. As it turned out, even a large brain is not a prerequisite for using tools. Small, solitary wasps from the genera Sphex and Amophila use pebbles to build burrows for their offspring in loose sand. To make this sand more dense, they tamp it with stones. Birds are also quite popular with tools. Parrots often use pieces of plastic or metal to lift the latch of their cage door. The woodpecker finch from the Galapagos Islands has an interesting way of using tools. To extract insect larvae from under the bark, it uses sharp twigs or cactus thorns. Among mammals, the main contender for second place after humans in the use of tools is the chimpanzee (Fig. 49.1). And chimpanzees make and use quite a few tools. These include, for example, stones used to crack nuts; sticks with bark stripped off to catch ants and termites; and sticks for different situations (e.g., to pick a fruit from a thin branch). Fig. 49.1. Tools in primates Elementary mental activity. The more we study animals, the more it becomes clear that there is no gap between human and animal thinking. All possible variants of mental activity can be found among animals: from the simplest actions based on reflexes (like a hydra) to the very complex thinking of great apes. But the most complex processes, similar to elementary human thinking, occur in the brains of birds and mammals. Among birds, ravens (crows, ravens, magpies, etc.) and parrots are considered leaders in the field of intelligence. Among mammals, the most intelligent are monkeys, dolphins, elephants, and predators. Studies of chimpanzees and gorillas have shown that their mental abilities are approximately at the level of a two- or three-year-old child. They are good at language. The structure of the larynx does not allow them to speak like humans, but they learn sign language quite easily. The record size of the vocabulary was held by Coco the gorilla, who knew about 1000 signs of sign language. The evolution of animal behavior Behavior is a significant result of evolution, one of the important adaptations of an organism to the environment. Different forms of behavior are selected in the course of evolution based on the principle of contributing to the survival of the species: the behavior that contributes more to survival is the one that is fixed. Remember the most important things The use of tools is inherent in different animals - insects, birds, mammals, etc. Many birds and mammals, such as monkeys, parrots, and elephants, have elementary mental activity. Behavior is an important feature of animals that helps them survive...Animal Behavior Conclusion We have looked at very important aspects of animal life that are related to behavior. Behavior is based on a common property of living organisms - irritability. The evolution of animals was aimed at developing this property, which led to the development of the nervous system and reflexes. Reflexes are the basis of behavior. A further complication was observed in the emergence of instincts - an innate rather complex system of actions. They are aimed at ensuring survival in stable conditions. The ability to learn significantly increased the species' chances of survival, as it allowed it to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
