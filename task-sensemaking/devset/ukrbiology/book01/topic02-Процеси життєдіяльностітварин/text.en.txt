 Unit 2 Animal Life Processes In this unit, you will learn about the basic functions of an animal organism: metabolism, nutrition, respiration, digestion, excretion, movement, sensitivity, reproduction, and development. There is an undeniable connection, on the one hand, between the structure and functions of each organism, and, on the other hand, between the peculiarities of the organization of each animal and its environment. These internal regularities have been formed over the course of long evolution. ANIMAL LIFE PROCESSES Metabolism and digestive systems of animals 31 One of the main properties of animals as living organisms is metabolism. Animals are heterotrophs. In the course of evolution, they have adapted to certain conditions of existence and obtain energy through food, which is done through digestion. Digestion is carried out by the organs of the digestive system. metabolism and nutrition One of the essential conditions of life is the exchange of substances and energy with the environment. That is, in order to exist, an animal's body must constantly receive substance and energy from the environment. This process is called nutrition. Animals are heterotrophic organisms. They cannot, like plants, receive energy from the sun's rays and synthesize organic substances from inorganic ones. To provide their bodies with energy, animals use organic substances: they break them down in their cells and store energy for their needs. Energy is necessary for movement, growth, development, and reproduction. Animals also use organic matter to build their bodies. They convert some organic substances into other substances that they need. 31.1. The white planarian flatworm has a closed digestive system The animal's body must break down the organic matter it receives from the environment into its constituents. These components are used in the metabolism. The process of breaking down complex organic substances in the body into simpler ones that can be used for its various needs is called digestion. Features of metabolism and digestive systems of animals the process of digestion, animals have a special system of organs - the digestive system. Its main function is to extract the proper amount of necessary substances from food and convert them into the form necessary for the body. There are two types of animal digestive system: closed and through. The closed digestive system consists of a mouth and a closed intestine (for example, in some worms). The through digestive system consists of the mouth, intestines, and ends with the anal opening. The structure of the latter type is shown in the table. Structure of the digestive system Part of the digestive system Organs What happens Area of eating Oral organs: Teeth, jaws, tongue, etc. Grinding or sucking up food, in some animals the process of digestion begins Passing food Oesophagus, esophagus Moving food to areas where digestion takes place First digestive site Stomach Breaking down some organic matter Second digestive site Foregut Breaking down organic matter The middle part of the intestine Absorption of food breakdown products The area of absorption of digestive products The area of accumulation of undigested residues The back part of the intestine The accumulation of undigested residues, active activity of symbiotic microorganisms Diversity of digestive systems The differences in animal digestive systems can be best seen in the area of food intake. The structure of this area depends on the way the animal eats. Fish Amphibian Reptile Mammal Colors are indicated: Bird - oesophagus - oesophagus - stomach - second stomach - intestine - liver - gallbladder - pancreas - cecum - rectum - cloaca Fig. 31.2. Diagrams of the structure of the digestive systems of representatives of different groups of animals Chewing Gnawing Sucking Sucking Slithering The structure of the digestive system of animals is associated with their habitat, method of feeding, and level of organization (Fig. 31.2). Methods of animal nutrition: - filtering (whales, mussels); - piercing with subsequent suction (bugs, aphids); - suction only (butterflies); - eating food in separate pieces with the help of jaws, teeth, or beak (wolves, birds, etc.). Mouthparts Most types of mouthparts are found in insects. The main ones are gnawing, sucking, spiny-sucking, gnawing-licking, and licking mouthparts (Fig. 31.3). They are also diverse in mammals, which have differentiated their teeth into incisors, canines, and angular teeth. The dental set of an animal depends on its lifestyle (Fig. 31.4). Tricks of the herbivores For herbivores, digestion is a very difficult process: plant foods are not easily digested. 31.3. Types of mouthparts in insects 126. Fig. 31.4. Teeth of carnivorous (tiger) and herbivorous (horse) mammals Fig. 31.5. The way food passes through the stomach of ruminants. Many plant substances can be decomposed only by microorganisms, so they often live in the digestive system of animals and even have their own special places. In cows and other ruminants, this place is the complex stomach, which has as many as four chambers (Fig. 31.5). In horses, rodents, and rabbits, the cecum is a place where beneficial microbes live (it is known as the appendix, which can become inflamed - appendicitis). Remember the most important thing Digestion is a set of processes that provide mechanical and chemical processing of food and prepare it for absorption by cells. In most animals, digestion is carried out by the digestive system...Animal life processes 32 Animal respiratory systems Respiration is one of the basic properties of living organisms, part of metabolism. Through respiration, animals receive energy for their vital activity. main functions of the respiratory system The respiratory system must supply the animal's body with oxygen and remove gaseous metabolic products, primarily carbon dioxide. In other words, in addition to breathing, the respiratory system also functions as an excretory system. Oxygen is needed to provide energy to the cells of the body. This energy is formed in the process of metabolism during the interaction of oxygen with organic substances in animal cells. Features of the respiratory system Components of the respiratory system Usually, the respiratory system of an animal consists of two main parts. The first is the respiratory surface, where the process of gas exchange takes place. For example, an earthworm breathes with the entire surface of its body; in mammals, the respiratory surface is the lungs. The second part is special structures (trachea, larynx, bronchi, etc.) that transport oxygen to the respiratory surface. Not all animals have the second part. It appears in those organisms that need to protect their respiratory surface from drying out. It first appeared in amphibians in connection with the transition to a terrestrial lifestyle. In some animals, this part reaches large sizes. Especially in those with long necks, such as swans, herons or storks. In addition, birds develop special air sacs that are also part of it. The breathing surface and its properties The breathing surface can only work if it has certain properties. These are shown in the table below. Animal respiratory systems. Main properties of the respiratory surface Property Why it is needed Good permeability Oxygen and other gases must pass through it easily Small thickness Gas transfer occurs by diffusion, and it is good only over short distances High humidity Gases penetrate the respiratory surface in a dissolved state Large area Only a certain amount of gas can pass through a unit surface area, so the larger the body size, the larger the surface area needed for gas exchange Problems of terrestrial respiration But they create a number of problems for land animals. For example, a large wet area means large losses of water, because it is through such surfaces that it evaporates most efficiently. This increases the risk of death for the animal. Therefore, the respiratory organs of land animals are usually hidden in various cavities inside the animal's body. Variety of respiratory systems The presence of certain respiratory organs in animals depends on their lifestyle (Figs. 32.1-32.2). The structure of different respiratory organs is shown in the table (p. 130). The earthworm breathes through the entire surface of its body The respiratory system of a grasshopper is represented by trachea Fig. 32.1. Variety of animal respiratory systems. Animal life processes. Nudibranchs are aquatic animals with external gills Bony fish have internal gills that are protected by gill covers The camel's lungs allow it to breathe easily even in the desert Fig. 32.2. Variety of animal respiratory systems Animal respiratory organ Respiratory organ Features of structure Which animal has Body surface External skin of animals. In terrestrial species, they are moist, with many glands Aquatic animals (small crustaceans, worms, ticks) or terrestrial animals that live in wet conditions (worms, ticks, amphibians) Arthropods (insects, arachnids) Trachea system A system of tubes, Gills Growths on the surface of the animal's body Crustaceans, some gastropods, all bivalves and cephalopods, fish, amphibians Some gastropods, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals Lungs Paired organs in the form of bags. Many animals have cellular lungs. Life without oxygen Some animals live in conditions where there is little or no oxygen. For example, parasitic worms that live in the intestines have nowhere to get oxygen. Therefore, they have to do without it and use other chemical reactions to generate energy. Of course, they are not as efficient as reactions with oxygen, but they are enough for the parasite's needs. And since there is no oxygen, there is no need for a respiratory system, so it disappeared. Animal respiratory systems Fig. 32.3. Woodlice - a land animal that breathes through its gills Trachea Lungs "Wrong" lungs and gills Most animals that have lungs breathe air, even if they live in water (like whales). And those animals with gills usually get oxygen from the water (like sharks). However, there are exceptions. Representatives of the needle-skinned sea cucumbers have water lungs, although they live at the bottom of the sea. And woodlice (Fig. 32.3) are one of the few crustaceans that have taken root on land. They thrive in deserts, despite the fact that they breathe with gills. Air sacs An efficient system The respiratory system of birds is extremely sophisticated (Fig. 32.4). In addition to the lungs, it includes air sacs, which do not exchange gas. However, the presence of these sacs allows birds to pass oxygen-rich air through their lungs both during inhalation and exhalation. This method is called double breathing. Fig. 32.4. Diagram of the respiratory system of a bird The main respiratory organs of animals are the lungs, gills, and trachea. There are animals that breathe through the entire body surface by diffusion and parasitic animals that have adapted to life in the absence of oxygen..Life processes and animals 33 Transport of substances in animals Transport of substances is necessary for multicellular organisms. This function is performed by the circulatory system in most animals. There are open and closed circulatory systems that perform important functions in the animal body. main functions of the transport system Fish heart Transporting substances (oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, metabolic products) between different parts of the animal body, the transport system connects these parts to each other. In small animals, some of the necessary substances can move through the body by diffusion. For large animals, this method is not enough - only the transport system allows them to move their resources quickly. In addition to the function of transferring substances, the transport system often also performs a protective function. For example, the circulatory system of mammals contains cells that destroy dangerous microorganisms. features of the structure of the transport system The contractile vessels of an earthworm The transport system is a system of channels through which a special fluid moves. In most animals, the circulatory system performs transport functions. Contractile organ The circulatory system has a special organ to ensure the movement of the transport fluid. This can be the heart or a special contractile vessel (Fig. 33.1). Fig. 33.1. The heart of a fish and the contractile vessels of an earthworm. Transportation of substances in animals Vessels Channels for fluid movement are represented by blood vessels. There are three types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry fluid from a contractile organ (they have the thickest walls). Veins carry blood to the contractile organ. Capillaries are the thinnest vessels. They carry out metabolism between the transport fluid and tissues. Transport fluid In animals, blood or hemolymph performs transport functions. Usually, the term "blood" is used for a fluid that moves only within the blood vessels and does not enter the body cavities of the organism. Accordingly, if the fluid in some areas goes into the body cavities, it is called hemolymph. Variety of transport systems There are two main types of circulatory systems: closed and open (Fig. 33.2). Their main features are described in the table. Characteristics of different types of circulatory systems Type of circulatory system Structure What kind of fluid circulates What animals have hemolymph Arthropods, mollusks Open circulatory system Transport fluid leaves the blood vessels in certain areas and enters the body cavity. Then it is collected again in the vessels Transport fluid circulates only through the vessels Blood Arthropods, vertebrates Closed circulatory system Insect circulatory system - open circulatory system Fish circulatory system - closed circulatory system Fig. 33.2. Schematic diagram of the structure of the closed and open circulatory systems. The life processes of animals  Heart Fig. 33.3 The circulatory system of a daphnia is represented by a single heart The development of the circulatory system and the structure of the heart depend on the size and lifestyle of the animal. A small daphnia has a circulatory system consisting of a single heart (Fig. 33.3), while a giant whale has a complex closed circulatory system and a heart consisting of four chambers. The structure of the heart of vertebrates is closely related to their respiration and lifestyle. Adaptation to life on land and the transition from gill to lung respiration led to the emergence of a second circulatory system and the appearance of three and then four chambers in the heart (Fig. 33.4). Gills Lungs Lungs Body Body Body Fish Amphibians Mammals Fig. 33.4. Diagrams of the circulatory system and heart structure of fish, amphibians, and mammals. Transport of substances in animals Fig. 33.5. Schematic of the structure of the transport system of the flatworm Not all transport systems are circulatory Not all animals have a circulatory system. However, all organisms need to perform transport functions, so they are taken over by other systems. For example, in parasitic suckers, the digestive system performs transportation functions (Fig. 33.5). It can be very extensive and penetrate all parts of the body. The larger the size of the worm, the more branched and complex its digestive system is. The color of the transport fluid The color of blood or hemolymph depends on the composition of the substances that transport oxygen and the degree of oxygen saturation. If these substances contain a Ferric atom, the color of the blood is red (vertebrates, some arthropods, etc.), and if they contain a Copper atom, the color of the blood is blue (cephalopods, some crustaceans, etc.). In some cases, Ferrous compounds give blood an unusual color. For example, in e In some ringworms, the blood is green or purple. remember the most important things In highly developed organisms, the circulatory system transports substances. It can be open (in mollusks, arthropods) and closed (in ringworms, cephalopods, and vertebrates). The blood in the body moves through the vessels - arteries, veins, and capillaries...Animal life processes 34 Excretions in animals During the metabolic process, animals constantly produce substances that can be harmful to them. That is why animals need to constantly remove them from their bodies. For this purpose, their bodies have a special excretory system. main functions of the excretory system Any metabolism involves two main processes. The first is the intake of necessary substances. The second is the excretion of unnecessary or harmful substances. In animals, the excretory system removes these substances from the body. This is its main function. The main one, but not the only one. Another important function of the excretory system is to maintain the stability of the internal environment of the body. If, for example, too much water has accumulated in an animal's body, its functioning may be disrupted. Excess water should be removed from the body. And if, on the contrary, there is not enough water, then its excretion should be reduced. This is what the excretory system does. It determines how much water should be excreted with metabolic products at a given moment - more or less. Features of the excretory system Excretion is the process of removing metabolic end products and toxins from the body. It is carried out diffusely or through special organs that are united in the excretory system. The excretory system of animals is mostly a system of tubes or channels, which are often combined into certain structures. Metabolic products are excreted through these tubes, channels, and structures. In animals, in addition to the special organs of the excretory system, the excretory processes are also carried out by organs of other systems. Especially active in these processes are the body's integumentary, respiratory, and digestive systems. Excretion in animals Excretion and the respiratory system The vast majority of gaseous metabolic products are excreted through the respiratory system. First of all, these are carbon dioxide and water, which are formed during breathing. However, other gaseous substances that are formed as a result of metabolism can also be excreted. Excretions and body integuments Body integuments perform important excretory functions in amphibians and mammals. In most mammals, they are dotted with sweat glands, which allow the body to remove excess heat, water, and salts. Variety of excretory systems There are many types of excretory systems. Their structure largely depends on the animal's metabolism and its environment (Fig. 34.1). The peculiarities of the structure of excretory organs are described in the table. Excretory organs of some animals Excretory organ Structure features Which animal has excretory tubes Pair of winding tubes with a funnel with cilia at the inner end Crustaceans Modified excretory tubes located at the base of the antennae and jaws (maxillae) in crustaceans. They look like a pouch from which a winding tubule extends outward Antennae (green) and maxillary glands Insects, arachnids Malpighian vessels Blindly closed tubes located at the border of the middle and hind gut of arthropods Molluscs, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals Kidneys An organ that contains a large number of structures that are modified winding tubules. The number and structure of these structures differ in different groups of animals. In reptiles, birds, and mammals, the kidneys consist of nephrons, which are complex but very efficient functional units. Life processes of worms. Ringworms Flatworms Excretory tubes Malpighian vessels Excretory tubes Insects Crustaceans Kidneys Mammals Green glands Fig. 34.1 Excretory organs of different animal groups. Excretion in animals Separate but very necessary In frogs, the bladder is separated from the excretory system, but it works continuously. The frog lives in very humid conditions, and the concentration of substances in its body is higher than in the environment. Since the frog's skin is easily permeable to water, water seeps in where the concentration of substances is higher. To prevent the frog from bursting, excess water must be removed from the body. This is what the bladder does. Do you want to fly? Get rid of the excess! One of the signs of birds' adaptation to flight is the absence of a bladder. If it were to fill up, it would make the bird heavier. The metabolic product in them is not urea (as in mammals), but uric acid, which is excreted from the bird's body along with undigested residues. Therefore, bird droppings containing uric acid can destroy metal structures. Non-main excretory organs Some animals develop special excretory glands to eliminate certain substances. For example, some birds (albatrosses, petrels, etc.) have salt glands that allow them to excrete excess salt from their bodies while using very little water. Thanks to these glands, birds can drink sea water. The salt glands are located on the head above the birds' eyes. The salt solution they produce is excreted through the nostrils. Albatrosses and petrels, which fly over the sea for a long time, have nostrils in the form of two tubes. This allows the birds to "shoot" droplets of the solution on the fly, because the solution does not flow out on its own during flight. The air flow carries the droplets back into the nostrils. Remember the most important thing Excretion is one of the functions of metabolism, thanks to which decay products and harmful substances are removed from the body. Not all animals have an excretory system. Small animals excrete unnecessary and toxic substances by diffusing them through the surface of the body..Life processes of animals 35 Musculoskeletal system. The skeleton The musculoskeletal system is common to all animals. Different animals have different organs of support and movement, which determine the shape and size of the body. The structure of the musculoskeletal system of animals depends on their environment. main functions of the musculoskeletal system The musculoskeletal system of animals enables them to move. It also protects all or most important internal organs from damage. This system also affects the spatial arrangement of the internal organs of animals that are attached to its elements. In addition, muscles, as part of the musculoskeletal system, are involved in the functioning of internal organs. They ensure the movement of food through the digestive system, move blood through blood vessels, and participate in the respiratory system. Features of the musculoskeletal system The musculoskeletal system consists of a large number of supporting and motor elements. For the most part, the motor elements in animals are represented by muscles, although some animals (e.g., starfish) use a system of tubes with high-pressure fluid to move. Animals move through muscle contractions. However, to ensure movement, the muscles must be attached to the supporting elements of the skeleton (Figs. 35.1-35.2), otherwise the length of the muscle will simply change and that is all. That is why the presence of both muscles and supporting elements is an essential component of any musculoskeletal system. Fig. 35.1. Attachment of a muscle to a vertebrate bone Fig. 35.2. Attachment of a muscle to an arthropod carapace. The musculoskeletal system. Skeleton Very important elements of the musculoskeletal system are the places where muscles attach to skeletal elements. For example, in vertebrates, bones have a complex surface relief of tubercles and depressions at the points of muscle attachment. It is by studying the relief of the bones of extinct animals that scientists reproduce the size and shape of their muscles. And they reproduce it very accurately. This is a difficult job, but thanks to it, we can learn how long-extinct animals looked and moved. Variety of musculoskeletal systems Depending on the location and structure of the supporting elements, there are several main types of animal skeletons (Fig. 35.3, p. 142), which are shown in the table. Types of animal skeletons Skeleton type Structure features Which animals have crustaceans, arachnids, insects, and other arthropods External The external skeleton is represented by a hard shell that covers the entire body of the animal from the outside. Most often, the basis of this shell is the substance chitin. Muscles are attached to it from the inside Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals Internal The internal skeleton is made up of bones and is located inside the animal's body. It is based on living bone or cartilage tissue rich in phosphorus compounds, which allows it to grow unhindered Ringworms, some mollusks Hydrostatic The hydrostatic skeleton is represented by cavities filled with pressurized fluid. These cavities are used as a support for the worms' muscles during movement Mixed Combines elements of different types of skeletons. For example, gastropods have both elements of the hydrostatic skeleton (cavities in the body filled with hemolymph) and elements of the external skeleton (shell) Gastropods, some cephalopods (nautiluses). Animal life processes. Earthworm (hydrostatic skeleton) Insect (external skeleton) Whale sharks (internal skeleton) Fig. 35.3. The wonders of hydrostatics The effectiveness of a hydrostatic skeleton can be demonstrated by using a plastic soda bottle. As long as the bottle is closed and the pressure in it is significant, it is very strong. You can put a fairly heavy object on it, and it will hold. But if you open it and pour water out of it, even a not-so-heavy object can easily flatten it. Repairing injuries Both animals with external and internal skeletons can be injured. But their support system recovers quite well. Although it happens in different ways. For example, a crayfish may lose its claw when attacked by a predator, but it will regain it after several molts. After the first molt, it will be still small, and then quickly catch up with the size of the surviving claw. Some animals with an internal skeleton (for example, newts) can also regrow lost limbs. But most of them can only heal fractures and other injuries. They can do this because their skeleton consists of living tannin. A fantastic dream about riding beetles The body size of animals with external skeletons is limited by the laws of physics. Their muscles must be placed inside the tubular limbs and the large limbs must have thick walls to support the animal's weight. Because of this, muscles with a large cross-sectional area cannot be placed inside the tubular limbs - it is limited by the diameter of the limb. It is the cross-sectional area that determines the strength of the muscle. In this case, the musculoskeletal system will not have enough strength to support the movements of a body with a large mass. That is why horse-sized beetles will remain only on the pages of science fiction novels. Musculoskeletal system. skeleton Fig. 35.5. Muscle movement of a butterfly during flight Fig. 35.4. Movement of dragonfly muscles during flight How do insects fly? Insects fly by moving their wings. Insects use two methods to raise and lower their wings. In the first case, muscles are attached directly to the wing tips (Figure 35.4). Their contraction and relaxation, together with the movements of the body segment plates, cause the wings to rise or fall. This is how dragonflies fly. In the second case, the muscles are not attached to the wings (Fig. 35.5). The muscles attached to the upper and lower plates of the thoracic segment of the insect's body lower the upper plate during contraction, which presses on the wing protrusion inside the segment. As a result, the wing is lifted. The contraction of the longitudinal muscles causes the same plate to rise, and as a result, the wings are lifted. This is how butterflies fly. Remember the most important things The musculoskeletal system is necessary for supporting the body and its individual parts, for moving the body and its organs, and for protecting the soft parts of the body. The musculoskeletal system consists of skeleton and muscles. The skeleton is a set of solid and supporting structures of the musculoskeletal system...Animal life processes Types of symmetry in animals. Ways of animal movement 36 All living organisms around us obey the laws of symmetry. Symmetry (from the Greek word "symmetry" - correspondence) is proportionality or harmony in the arrangement of equal parts. Types of animal symmetry Fig. 36.1. Jellyfish and polyps have radial body symmetry There are two main types of body symmetry in animals. These are ray (radial) symmetry and bilateral (bilateral) symmetry. In addition, some animals have an asymmetrical body structure (gastropods). Animals with radial body symmetry If you look at animals with radial symmetry, you will see that you can draw several planes through their bodies that will divide them into two equal halves (Fig. 36.1). Such animals are intestinal cnidarians. Radial symmetry is convenient for animals that are attached (polyps) or sedentary (jellyfish). It allows them to catch prey or defend themselves from predators equally effectively, no matter which side they approach from. Animals with bilateral body symmetry If we look at animals with bilateral symmetry, we see that only one plane can be drawn through their body, which will divide it into two equal halves. Such animals are vertebrates, arthropods, and ringworms (Figure 36.2). Fig. 36.2. Fish and insects have bilateral body symmetry. Respiratory systems of animals. Ways of animal movement Bilateral symmetry is convenient for animals that usually move actively. For them, the division of the body into front and back parts is very important. The front part (i.e., the head) contains sensory organs that signal to the animal what is ahead. If there is a front and a back, then the right and left sides of the body appear accordingly in relation to the direction of movement. Ways Animals move Animals have different ways of moving depending on their environment and lifestyle (Figure 36.3). The table (p. 146) describes these ways. An insect larva crawls Walking is the main way an elephant moves Jumping is the kangaroo's calling card A flying squirrel is a master glider A tuna swims extremely fast A hummingbird flies perfectly Figure 36.3. 36.3. Ways of Moving Animals. Common Ways of Moving. Animals Way of Moving Who uses it and how Purpose Almost all groups of animals use this way of moving. It is the main way worms move around. In arthropods, insect larvae crawl. Among mollusks, crawling is mostly used by gastropods. Among vertebrates, snakes and legless lizards, as well as amphibians, crawl. All animals with limbs or limb-like structures crawl. Polychaetes use parapodia for this purpose. Arthropods have articulated limbs. And among vertebrates, not only limbs (terrestrial groups) but also fins (some fish) are used for walking. To do this, they use either modified jumping limbs (grasshoppers, fleas, frogs, kangaroos) or special body appendages (bristles of some insects) Swimming This type of movement is used by almost all animals that live in water. There are different ways of swimming: - paddling with modified limbs like paddles (arthropods); - swimming with wave-like movements of the whole body (worms); - jet-like movement (cephalopods); - swimming with wave-like movements of a part of the body or individual fins (fish) Active flight This way of movement was mastered only by insects and vertebrates (birds, bats). But they adapted to it in different ways. The wings of insects appeared as bulges in the side of their bodies, while the wings of birds and mammals are modified forelimbs Passive flight During this type of flight, an animal uses air currents and its own devices for planning. Some mammals, lizards, snakes, amphibians, fish, spiders. ypes of symmetry in animals. ways animal movements Step Trot Walk Gallop Fig. 36.4. The main ways of movement in horses Allure in horses There are four main ways of movement in horses (Fig. 36.4). Trot - when the animal walks, moving each leg in turn. Trot - when the animal walks by moving the right front and left hind legs first, and then the left front and right hind legs. Trot - when the animal simultaneously moves both legs on the same side: first, the two left legs, then the two right legs. Galloping is the fastest way of movement, during which at certain moments all the animal's legs leave the ground. Reactive movement Reactive movement is the most common among mollusks. Cephalopods even have special devices for this. This is a mantle cavity into which they collect water, and a funnel through which the animal forces a stream of water. By turning the opening of the funnel in the right direction, the mollusk can change the direction of its movement. Remember the most important things In the animal kingdom, there are two types of symmetry - radial, or radial, and bilateral, or bilateral. Most animals have bilateral symmetry, which favors animals that actively move in space. There are many ways of movement, including walking, running, jumping, swimming, flying, gliding, and gliding.
