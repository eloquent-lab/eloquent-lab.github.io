 Unit 1: Animal Diversity In this unit, you will study the main groups of animals, their defining features and biological characteristics. You will learn how they have adapted to their environment, how they interact with each other, and what role they play in nature. In addition, you will understand how human interests are closely related to each species. Each species, each group of animals has its own role in the life of our planet. If we think that some animals do not play a role in our lives, it only means that we do not know them very well. Throughout the unit, you will explore the lives of sea and ocean creatures, soil organisms, terrestrial animals, and those that have chosen to live in other places. Animal Diversity 5 Classification and Importance of Animals The famous ancient Greek scientist Aristotle divided living organisms into two large kingdoms, Plants and Animals, in the fourth century BC. Why do we divide living organisms into groups? And why is the animal group special? What is their benefit or harm? Let's try to figure it out. Dividing animals into groups. How did it happen? People have always realized that there are many different animals. Even in primitive societies, they were divided into groups. Now we call this division a classification. The first classifications were very simple: these animals can be eaten, and these cannot. So there are two groups: edible and inedible animals. But you can divide animals in a completely different way: those that hunt humans (for example, tigers), those that humans hunt themselves (for example, hares), and those that do not fall into the first two groups (for example, the crusader spider). Over time, new classifications began to appear. And with that came the problem of misunderstandings between scientists from different countries. How can they agree with each other if, for example, the word "frog" in Ukrainian and Russian denotes completely different animals? That is why we had to find a common language and develop classification rules. To avoid confusion, they agreed to give all the names in Latin. modern classification of animals The basis of any classification in biology is the species. A species is a group of animals that has a common origin, the same structure, and occupies a specific habitat. Each animal belongs to a specific species. The scientific name of a species consists of two words. The full name is written in Latin, and for convenience, it is translated into the local language in each country (Figure 5.1). A species should not be confused with a breed. Breeds are formed as a result of human activity, which creates them for their own purposes, and are not different species. For example, different breeds of dogs belong to the same species, the domestic dog. Classification and significance of animals House sparrow Domestic dog Broad-toed crayfish Fig. 5.1. Any animal belongs to a specific species Common woodpecker White-backed woodpecker Woodpecker medium woodpecker Fig. 5.2. 5.2. Representatives of the species of the genus Woodpecker Scientists group similar species that descend from the same ancestor. These groups are called genera. Note that the first word in the species name is the name of the genus. For example, the green burdock species belongs to the genus Burdock, and the domestic dog belongs to the genus Dog. The wolf also belongs to the same genus. Its scientific name is translated as "wolf dog". And in our forests we can see, for example, several representatives of the Woodpecker genus (Fig. 5.2). We all belong to the species Homo sapiens, the genus Homo. The name of the species - Homo sapiens - is written in Latin as Homo sapiens L. The letter L stands for the first letter of the name of the scientist Carl Linnaeus, who described this species. He is the only scientist whose name is abbreviated in this way. Other authors of species names are given in full. This is a sign of respect for the scientist who created the principles of modern taxonomy. Scientists combine similar genera into families. For example, the genus Dog, the genus Arctic Fox and the genus Fox are part of the family Canidae. And the genera Chimpanzee, Gorilla, and Orangutan are united in the family Apes. Animal families, in turn, are organized into larger groups - orders. For example, the families Dog, Bear, and Cat belong to the order Carnivora. And the families are organized into classes. For example, the class Mammalia includes the orders Carnivora, Primates, Cloven-hoofed, etc. Diversity of animals Carl von Linnaeus (1707-1778) was a prominent Swedish biologist and professor at Uppsala University. The scientist focused on the systematics of living organisms. He is the author of the modern classification of plants and animals, in which each species has a two-word Latin name. Linnaeus described many species of plants and animals. In turn, the classes are grouped into types. For example, the type Chordates consists of the classes Mammals, Reptiles, Birds, etc. And the Arthropoda type includes such classes as Insects and Crustacea. Finally, the types are combined into the kingdom of Animals, the same kingdom that Aristotle distinguished. Type Class Order Family Genus Species If scientists come across a new species, they first classify it, i.e., determine to which animal group it belongs. This, firstly, allows scientists to understand what species they are talking about in a particular study, and secondly, it allows them to figure out what can be obtained from this species. If we know that a new species of beetle belongs to the Turuni family, which are mostly predators, we can try to use it to control certain agricultural pests. How can we assign an animal to a particular group? To do this, scientists study it in detail. They take into account the peculiarities of its external and internal structure, distribution area, and life habits. They also use more sophisticated modern research methods. External similarities are not always an indicator of close kinship. For example, whales that live in the water are similar in body shape to fish, but their closest relatives are still mammals. Because whales breathe with their lungs and feed their young with milk, they are classified as mammals. The importance of animals for humans Positive - A source of food (domestic and wild animals). - Source of raw materials for industry - wool, leather, silk, etc. Classification and importance of animals - Transportation (horses, camels, donkeys). - Pollinators of plants (bees, bumblebees, etc.). - Distributors of fruits and seeds (mammals, birds, etc.). - Source of medicinal raw materials - propolis, wax, antlers, snake venom, etc. - Source of positive emotions (domestic and wild animals). - Destroyers of dead organic matter, such as fallen leaves (insects, worms, etc.). - Water purifiers (oysters, pearl mussels, etc.). Negative - Attacks on humans (predatory animals, some large herbivores). - Pathogens (parasitic worms and arthropods). - Disease vectors (mosquitoes, flies, etc.). - Poisonous animals (spiders, insects, snakes, fish, etc.). - Agricultural pests (Colorado potato beetle, broomrape, etc.). - Destroyers of structures and materials (termites, mollusks, etc.). Remember the most important things The modern system of animal life is based on the identification of the relationship between animals. Each animal belongs to a specific species. Similar species are grouped into genera, families, orders, classes, and types. Animals play an important role in nature and in human life. Animals bring many benefits to humans, but they also often cause harm..Diversity of animals 6 Gastropoda Gastropoda have a very simple structure. They are one of the simplest multicellular animals. And, by the way, they are one of the oldest, having existed for more than half a billion years. But all this does not prevent them from playing a significant role not only in human life and nature, but also in geological processes. Distribution and lifestyle Most gastropods live in the seas and oceans, but there are also freshwater species. In water bodies, they either attach themselves to the bottom or some objects, or swim in the water column. They can be found both near the surface and at great depths. Polyps and jellyfish The gastropods can be divided into polyps and jellyfish. Polyps are mostly sedentary: they attach themselves to the soil or objects with their soles. Their mouthparts, surrounded by tentacles, are located at the top. Polyps often form colonies to hunt together and defend themselves against enemies. Jellyfish are more mobile. Their body is shaped like a bell, and their mouth and tentacles are located at the bottom. Jellyfish swim according to the principle of jet propulsion: they push water from inside their "bell" and move in the opposite direction from the direction of the water jet. features of structure Body size. The size of the gastropods is very different. The smallest of them are only a few millimeters long. The brown hydra is usually less than 1 cm, and the world's largest jellyfish, the cyanide jellyfish, has an umbrella 2 m in diameter and tentacles up to 20 m long. Body structure. The body of a gastropod resembles a bag with a mouth, inside which is the intestinal cavity,- Hence the name Gastropods Tentacles Tentacles with ejected filament Mouth opening Gut cavity Gut cavity Gut cavity Gut cavity Gut cavity Inner layer of cells (entoderm) Extracellular substance (mesoglea) Outer layer of cells (ectoderm) Outer layer of cells (ectoderm) At rest Tentacles Tentacles Tentacles Fig. 6.1. Structure of polyp and jellyfish Fig. 6.2. Stinging cell and its name. The walls of the sac are thin. They consist of only two layers of cells, between which there is a gelatinous extracellular substance (mesoglea). This layer can be thin (in polyps) or thick (in jellyfish) (Fig. 6.1). Stinging cells. Stinging cells are a characteristic feature of the gastropods. They are used by these animals to hunt prey and defend themselves against enemies. The outside of the cell has a sensitive hair. Inside, there is a spiraling thread with a pointed end. When the sensory hair is irritated, the spiral straightens sharply, the point is stuck into the victim, and a drop of venom is injected along the thread (Fig. 6.2). Reproduction and development There are two ways of reproduction: sexual and asexual. During sexual reproduction, one individual forms special male germ cells, and the other forms female germ cells. The cells separate from the animal and float in the water. When they meet, the male and female cells merge and form a single cell, from which a new animal grows. During asexual reproduction, no special cells are formed. The animal's body forms a hollow, on which tentacles grow and a mouth is formed. After that, the new animal separates from the mother. This method of reproduction is called budding, and the hollow is called a bud (Fig. 6.3, p. 26). Diversity of animals Diversity There are more than 10,000 species of these animals, including hydroids, jellyfish, actinids, and corals. A typical representative of polyps is the stalked or brown hydra. Representatives of jellyfish are the well-known jellyfish of the Black and Azov Seas - aurelia and coroneroth (Fig. 6.4). Actinia. Actinia are single coral polyps without a hard skeleton (Fig. 6.5). Their numerous tentacles are dotted with stinging cells, which are used by other organisms. Hermit crayfish transplant actinia onto their shell huts for protection. The actinia also benefit from other organisms: they feed on the crayfish's leftovers. This beneficial coexistence is called mutualism. Corals with a hard skeleton. Hard-skinned corals lead an exclusively attached lifestyle, and were even once considered plants. After budding, the daughter does not "separate" from the mother - this is how a colony is formed (Fig. 6.6). A young individual of the budworm Fig. 6.3. Asexual reproduction of the hydra Fig. 6.4. Root jellyfish - an inhabitant of the Azov and Black Seas Fig. 6.5. 6.5. A hermit crayfish with actinia on its shell Fig. 6.6. 6.6. A colony of corals forming a coral reef Gastropods Record-breaking structure The largest structure created by living organisms is the Great Barrier Reef off the eastern coast of Australia. It stretches for 2 thousand kilometers and is 70 kilometers wide. This is a whole world created by corals, bright and colorful, with a variety of ocean fish, mollusks, worms. significance for humans Positive - They participate in the formation of islands where people live (corals). - They are a source of materials for construction (corals). - Used for making jewelry (red corals). Negative - They form reefs that make it difficult for ships to navigate and can cause accidents (corals). - Can lead to the death of people if they are exposed to stinging cell venom (sea wasp, physalis, etc.). - In the case of excessive reproduction, they interfere with tourists at seaside resorts (rootwort, aurelia, etc.). Remember the most important things: Cnidarians are multicellular aquatic organisms. The body is two-layered, consisting of ectoderm and entoderm. They have a mouth, intestinal cavity and tentacles. There are stinging cells. They reproduce sexually and asexually (budding). They play an important role in geological processes...Diversity of animals 7 Ringworms (roundworms) We usually do not pay attention to them, although these animals are largely responsible for soil fertility and the number of fish in the seas and rivers. And it is they who are engaged in "cleaning" our forests from fallen leaves. Big or small, but so important for both nature and humans - worms and leeches! Distribution and habitat Habitat Ringworms are found in a variety of environments. They can be found on the soil surface and underground. They live in fresh and saltwater bodies of water. In the oceans, some of these animals swim in the water column, while others live almost stationary on the bottom. At the same time, they build special tubes in which they hide from enemies. What do they eat and who eats them? There are predators among them that hunt other animals. There are also those that feed on the remains of dead organisms. Quite a few species are filter feeders, catching organic particles by passing water through special filtering structures. There are also parasitic ringworms, such as the medical leech. These animals themselves serve as food for many aquatic and terrestrial animals. They are eaten by fish, frogs, birds, animals, insects, and crayfish. structural features Body size The body size of ringworms is very diverse. There are tiny species that are less than 1 mm long. The largest representatives have a body length of more than 3 m. Some marine species and the Australian earthworm, which lives underground, are this big (Fig. 7.1). Ringed structure Ringworms get their name because their body is divided into separate segments (Fig. 7.2). From the outside, it seems that it consists of ringworms (ringworms) Fig. 7.1. Australian earthworm made of separate rings that are connected to each other. Many species are characterized by the presence of a girdle - several thickened segments in the front part of the body. Body outgrowths A characteristic feature of these animals is the presence of chitinous bristles on the body. Some ringworms have many such bristles, and they are gathered in bunches, for example, in the sand lance and nereis. Others have fewer bristles, and they are not gathered in bundles, for example, the pipistrelle. Many species of ringworms have lateral outgrowths on their body segments called parapodia (Fig. 7.2), which they use for movement, such as the nereis. And leeches have suckers. Reproduction and development These animals can reproduce both asexually and sexually. During asexual reproduction, the animal's body is divided into several fragments, each of which forms a new individual (Fig. 7.3, p. 30). During sexual reproduction, ringworms lay fertilized eggs (Fig. 7.4, p. 30). The eggs hatch into either small worms that look like adults or larvae (in marine species). The larvae swim for some time and then settle to the bottom and turn into adults Sucker Anal blade Parapodia Body part Belt Segments Head part Earthworm Leech Nereis Fig. 7.2. Features of the structure of ringworms on the example of an earthworm, leech and nereis Diversity of animals Fig. 7.4. Cocoon with earthworm eggs Fig. 7.3. Reproduction of the ringworm by fragmentation Fig. 7.6. Fish leech - a parasitic animal Fig. 7.5. 7.5. The sea mouse, or aphrodite, is a multi-bristled worm that leads a crawling worm life. Among the cnidarians are many hermaphrodites - organisms that form both male and female germ cells. Diversity There are more than 12,000 species of ringworms. Traditionally, they are divided into groups such as polychaetes, tapeworms, and leeches. The polychaetes are the largest group of ringworms. Most polychaetes are marine inhabitants. There are free-swimming, crawling, and sessile species (Figure 7.5). Some of them live at great depths. Among the small bristlecone animals are marine, freshwater, and soil animals. They feed on organic residues, other animals, and parasitic species. A typical representative is the earthworm. Ringworms The segmented worm-like body of leeches is flattened. The leeches have no bristles. There are suckers at the front and back ends of the body. These ringworms can swim and move on land with the help of suckers. There are more than 400 species of leeches in the world, which are mostly parasites or predators (Fig. 7.6). Medicinal leeches have long been successfully used in medicine. importance for humans Positive - Increase soil fertility (earthworms). - Recycle fallen leaves (earthworms). - They are food for many commercial fish (nereis, sand lance, etc.). - Purify contaminated water (pipe worms, etc.). - Eaten as food (palolo, etc.). - Used in medicine (leeches). Negative - Some species are parasites and can infect humans and pets (leeches). remember the most important things The characteristic feature of roundworms is the ringed body. Ringworms are divided into small-bodied worms, large-bodied worms, and leeches. These animals are of great importance: they are part of nature, important links in food chains. Earthworms are good soil builders. There are water filterers among earthworms. There are parasitic species that cause harm to humans and animals, as well as species used in medicine..Diversity of animals Arthropods. Crustaceans 8 Arthropods are the dominant group of animals on Earth. It includes more than 1.5 million species. Their bodies are covered with a shell and their legs are made up of individual segments, which is why they are called arthropods. The most famous representatives of arthropods are crustaceans, arachnids, and insects. Distribution and lifestyles of arthropods Habitat Representatives of arthropods can be seen anywhere. They live on the ground and underground, in water, in the air, and on other living things (Figure 8.1). They include sedentary, crawling, swimming, and flying species. Crustaceans are representatives of arthropods that live mainly in water. Although there are some terrestrial species among them. What do they eat and who eats them? Arthropods (and crustaceans in particular) have all possible variants of animal nutrition. They can be predators or herbivores, filter feeders or parasites, and eat dead organisms. They themselves are eaten by a huge number of living organisms: intestinal worms, worms, mollusks, fish, frogs, lizards, birds, animals, and, of course, other arthropods. Butterfly Spider Langoustine (air environment) (land environment) (water environment) Fig. 8.1. Representatives of arthropods and their habitats Arthropods. Crustaceans Fig. 8.2. The largest representative of crustaceans - the Japanese spider crab Features of crustacean structure Body size Among crustaceans there are the smallest and largest representatives of arthropods. The smallest is the parasitic crustacean, whose body length is 0.1 mm. And the largest is the Japanese spider crab: саме its body is about 45 cm long, but its leg span reaches 4 m. This crab weighs up to 20 kg (Fig. 8.2). Body parts The body consists of separate segments. In most crustaceans, it is divided into three parts: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. In some, the first two body parts merge to form the cephalothorax (Fig. 8.3). The body of crustaceans is covered with a chitinous shell. On the head, two complex eyes, consisting of many small eyes, are clearly visible. Legs and their modifications Legs are located on the body segments of crustaceans. Large, well-developed legs, which help the animal to move, are called walking legs (Fig. 8.3). But many segments have different functions. The legs on the head have evolved to become jaws. Eggs can be attached to the legs on the abdomen. Thus, they participate in the reproduction process. In addition, crustaceans have two pairs of antennae on their heads. The animals use them as sensory organs. use them as sensory organs. Long whiskers Cephalothorax Abdomen Short whiskers Abdominal swimming legs Claws (first pair of walking legs) Walking legs Tail fin Fig. 8.3. External structure of a crayfish Diversity of animals Diversity of crustaceans More than 30 thousand crustaceans are known, including important commercial species: shrimps, lobsters, lobsters, crabs. Their meat is a tasty and valuable product containing mineral salts and vitamins necessary for people. Woodlice Woodlice are the only group of crustaceans that live and reproduce on land (Fig. 8.4). Surprisingly, these animals are common in deserts and semi-deserts of Africa, West and Central Asia. They live in places where groundwater is shallow. Woodlice are good soil builders, just like earthworms, which are not found there. Filter-feeding crustaceans Sea acorns (balanus) and sea ducks are sedentary, living on rocks and ship bottoms (Fig. 8.5). They feed by filtering organic particles from the water. Their modified legs resemble branched whiskers, which they use to draw water to their mouths. Krill Tiny eufauzid crustaceans, 3-5 mm long, live in huge clusters called krill (Fig. 8.6). Krill is the main food of herring, sea bass, cod, and minke whales. Seagulls, penguins, and humans also eat krill, which is rich in proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. The small shield is an amazing crustacean. It has hardly changed in 200 million years. Probably because it is active only two weeks out of 365 days a year, and the rest of the time it exists in the form of eggs that can remain viable for up to 15 years. Fig. 8.4. Woodlice - representatives of terrestrial crustaceans Fig. 8.5. Sea ducks are attached to a support with a special leg Fig. 8.6. 8.6. Krill - a representative of industrial crustaceans Arthropods. Crustaceans The value of crustaceans for humans Positive - They are used for food (crabs, crayfish, lobsters, shrimps, etc.). - Regulate the number of aquatic invertebrates (crabs, crayfish, etc.). - They are a source of food for many commercial fish (crayfish, crabs, larvae of large species and small crustaceans). - They are used as indicators of the state of the environment (daphnia). - Purify water (sea acorns, sea ducks). - They are good soil builders (woodlice). Negative - Some impede the movement of ships when they settle on their hulls (sea acorns). - They can accumulate on hydraulic structures (e.g., locks or hoppers) and disrupt their operation (sea acorns, sea ducks). - They can injure fishermen or scuba divers (lobsters, crabs, etc.). - Parasitic species can harm commercial fish and crustacean species (carp, saculina). - They can be carriers of human diseases (cyclopes). Remember the most important things Arthropods are animals with an articulated body (head, chest, abdomen) covered with a chitinous shell. They live in all environments - in water, on land, and underground. Many representatives are capable of flight. The most famous representatives of arthropods are crustaceans, arachnids, and insects. Crustaceans are mostly aquatic organisms. They have two pairs of antennae and compound eyes on their heads.... They often cause us fear, although not all of them are dangerous. We often simply sweep away their webs and do not even think about the uniqueness of these amazing arachnids. Distribution and lifestyle Habitat Arachnids are representatives of arthropods, which include spiders, ticks, scorpions, and spider weevils. They are mostly terrestrial inhabitants. Although there are freshwater species among spiders and ticks, and one group of ticks lives in the sea. Many spiders are predators that hunt with the help of a fishing net - a web. On their abdomens there are spider warts, and in them there are glands that produce fluid. It solidifies in the air, forming a web. Why does the spider not stick to its web? The radial threads along which it runs are non-sticky, and the spiral threads have drops of adhesive fluid on them. What do they eat and who eats them? Spiders are mostly ambush predators. Those that make webs wait for prey to fall into them. Prey can be any small animal. These are mostly insects. Once caught in the web, the victim breaks free and swings it. The spider runs up to the victim and injects venom into it, which first paralyzes it and then decomposes its body from the inside. After a while, the spider sucks out the half-digested mixture. There are also herbivorous species among arachnids. These are mainly ticks. There are also many parasites among them. For example, herbivorous spider mites can become dangerous pests of crops. In addition, they can be carriers of plant diseases. Spiders are hunted by insects, frogs, lizards, birds, and small animals. Arachnids structure features of arachnids Fig. 9.1. The tarantula is the world's largest spider Body size The largest spider is the tarantula, which lives in the forests of South America (Fig. 9.1). Some specimens are over 20 cm long. The smallest spider in the world is the Patu marplesi spider. In Western Samoa, a specimen was found just over 4 mm long. Body parts The body of a spider consists of a cephalothorax and abdomen (Fig. 9.2). On the cephalothorax there are four pairs of simple eyes, chelicerae (modified limbs with venom glands), pedipalps (modified limbs without venom glands) and four pairs of walking legs with claws. Arachnids have no antennae. There are no limbs on the abdomen; it has spiracles, genital and anal openings. The body and limbs of arachnids are covered with hairs. Diversity More than 100 thousand species of arachnids are now known: spiders, ticks, scorpions, and other groups. Caracurtus The caracurtus lives in the steppe zone and in southern Ukraine (Fig. 9.3, p. 38). The venom of its female is 15 times stronger than that of a rattlesnake. Bites cause severe pain all over the body and loss of consciousness, and 3% of people bitten die. If the victim is promptly injected with anti-rabbit serum, he or she will recover in three to four days.

Ixodes tick - a bloodsucker, a carrier of encephalitis Fig. 9.7. 9.7. The Crimean scorpion is nocturnal Tarantula The tarantula is a poisonous spider that lives in the southern regions of Ukraine (Fig. 9.4). Its bite causes severe pain, swelling, and difficulty breathing, but the symptoms disappear in 5-6 hours. The silverback spider lives in ponds and rivers. It builds its home underwater from a web, filling it with air bubbles, which it needs for breathing (Fig. 9.5). Ticks These are small arachnids. Their body segments are fused. Parasitic ticks transmit many infectious diseases, among which are very dangerous typhoid fever, encephalitis, tularemia, taiga encephalitis, etc. (Fig. 9.6). The itch mite causes scabies. Spider mites are parasitic on plants. Many species of mites are soil builders, feeding on rotten plant debris. Scorpions Large predators, have a webbed abdomen with a poisonous sting at the end (Fig. 9.7). The pedipalps end in pincers, which they use to catch and hold their prey. Scorpions bring the stinger from above and stab the victim, injecting venom. Arachnids Reproduction and development Spiders reproduce sexually. The female is larger in size. Spiders lay fertilized eggs in a cocoon, from which young individuals later emerge. They release a web-sail, which is picked up by the wind, carrying the young over a long distance. for humans Positive - Control the number of harmful insects and other small organisms (spiders, scorpions, etc.). - They are a source of webs used in some industries (spiders). - Used in the food industry, for example, in the manufacture of some cheeses (ticks). Negative - Pathogens of some diseases (ticks). - Carriers of certain diseases (ticks). - Poisonous species can be dangerous to human life (spiders, scorpions). - Some species are pests of agriculture (ticks). Remember the most important things Arachnids are land animals, but there are also some that live in water. Their body consists of a cephalothorax and abdomen. They have eight walking limbs with claws, simple eyes, no antennae, and chelicerae and pedipalps on the cephalothorax. Poisonous arachnids can be dangerous to humans. Some of them are pathogens and carriers of dangerous diseases...Diversity of the Tauridae 10 Insects Our planet can be justifiably called the planet of insects. These animals are the most numerous on Earth! They have mastered all habitats. Among them are many that cause us a lot of harm. And there are just as many that bring us great benefit. Habitat and lifestyle Insects can be found everywhere - in forests, fields, caves, soil, rivers, lakes, etc. Some have even adapted to living in the seas, although there are few of them. However, sea water mice can be seen on the ocean surface very far from the shore. Some insects have adapted to living alongside humans, such as cockroaches and bed bugs. Moving alongside humans, they have populated our entire planet. What do they eat and who eats them? Insects eat everything and are eaten by everyone. It's hard to find any more or less large group of animals that doesn't have someone willing to eat insects. They are eaten by other arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Imagine, if there are more than a million species of insects and each eats only its own kind, it is not surprising that we sometimes do not even realize what unusual things can serve as food for them (Fig. 10.1). Plants, meat Puffballs feed on bird down Termites eat wood Wasps feed their larvae on meat Fig. 10.1. What Insects Eat Insects or other arthropods on the insect "menu" are unlikely to surprise anyone. Probably, almost everyone has heard about nutritious nectar and pollen from flowers. If you think about it, you can also remember the moths that feed on our woolen clothes. But what is really impressive is when insects eat wax or medicines. 10.2. The stick insect is the largest insect, and the hoverfly is the smallest Body size The body size of the smallest insects is only 0.2 mm. The body length of the largest insects exceeds 30 cm. One of the stick insects is considered the largest insect. Its body grows up to 35 cm, and with its legs extended, the total length exceeds 50 cm. The smallest is the tiny rider, which is only 0.139 mm long (Fig. 10.2). Body parts The body of an insect consists of a head, thorax, and abdomen (Fig. 10.3). The head has one pair of antennae, a mouthparts, and compound eyes. The thorax has three pairs of walking legs and wings (some insects do not have wings). Females of some species may have a long ovipositor on their abdomen. It is used to lay eggs. Wings Wings (one or two pairs) are folds of the body wall, so they are two-layered. In some insects (dragonflies), both pairs of wings are equally developed; in beetles, the front pair has turned into hard protective elytra that do not participate in flight. There are wingless forms (fleas, bedbugs). Thorax Head First pair of wings Eye Second pair of wings Antennae Abdomen Walking legs Fig. 10.3. External structure of an insect Variety of animals Running Jumping Digging Swimming Grasping Gathering Fig. 10.4. Different types of insect legs Walking legs The articulated limbs of insects are more complex in structure than those of crustaceans and arachnids and are better adapted to the way of life of these organisms (Fig. 10.4). They can be running, like a cockroach, jumping, like a grasshopper, swimming, like a floating beetle, or digging, like a bear. Color and body shape Insects vary in color and shape. This helps them adapt to a particular habitat and lifestyle. Some are bright and beautiful (butterflies), while others are inconspicuous. What is the reason for this? If the color and shape of the body allow an insect to blend in with the environment, to become invisible to a predator or prey, it is called defensive. A green grasshopper will be invisible in green grass, a brightly colored flower will be invisible on a brightly colored butterfly. An insect can resemble a knot, a leaf, etc. by its body shape. The color can be a warning. If a bird pecks at a brightly colored bee, wasp, or bug, it will associate the pain of the bite, the disgusting taste or smell of the insect with its color, and will not eat such insects for some time. Poisonous insects Insects do not need to have a sting to be poisonous. They can simply accumulate poison in their bodies. This is what Colorado potato beetles and beetle-eaters do. It is not advisable to pick up these insects. And if you do, you should wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. Diversity The number of insect species exceeds 1 million. Many of them have not yet been studied sufficiently, and many of their species can still be discovered. Wasp Insects are abundant in tropical countries. But in Ukraine, there is a very large number of them: butterflies (whiteflies, silkworms), beetles (beetles, bark beetles, leaf beetles, whiskers), hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps), bedbugs, cockroaches, grasshoppers, and other insects. - They produce food - honey (bees). - They are used for food (locusts, grasshoppers, etc.). - They regulate the number of pests (locusts, bedbugs, etc.). - Used in medicine (bees, etc.). - They are pollinators of cultivated plants. Negative - Some species are pests of agriculture (Colorado potato beetle, odd silkworm, etc.). - Can be pathogens (lice, ticks, etc.). - Can be vectors of disease (lice, fleas, ticks, etc.). - Some species are poisonous (boil beetles, etc.). Remember the most important things Insects are highly evolved animals that have mastered all habitats. They have chitinous covers, and their bodies consist of a head, thorax, and abdomen. They have one pair of antennae, compound eyes, three pairs of walking legs, and most of them have wings. They are capable of carrying diseases and causing significant damage to the human economy. They are a source of silk, honey, and medicines.
